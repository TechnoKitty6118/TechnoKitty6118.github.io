            <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a inspiring game developer and I mostly do the design of games but I can also do the art for the game if needed and do programing as well. 
            I have a few hobies I mostly play games either by myself of with my friends and make games when I can. I enjoy playing and taking my dogs on walks and watching stuff on various platforms.
            Some of the types of games I like  to play are RPGs, sandbox games, and dungeon crawlers as I play a lot of those types of games.
